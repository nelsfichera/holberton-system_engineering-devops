Final screens @ ./final-screens

### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open the necessary files:
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

#### Important notes with Figma:

> if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
> “Be pixel perfect” - yes! but mainly make sure colors, size and position are correct. #C271FF is not purple.
>For this task, please write an amazing README.md

#### Interactions note:

> Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
> Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
> button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

### 1. Header first
Let’s start by the Homepage: create the header/hero piece

All assets needed can be found here:

> ./images
> ./images/holberton_school-icons

### 2. Carousel of quotes
Create the section “Carousel of quotes”

By using a Carousel component of Bootstrap, create this Carousel of quotes.

<!-- You can have for the moment one quote or twice the same for testing (like example below) -->

### 3. Popular videos
Create the section “Most popular tutorials”

By using a Carousel component of Bootstrap, create this Carousel of video cards.

#### Reminder:
> Desktop: 4 cards
> Tablet: 2 cards
> Mobile: 1 card

#### 4. Row of smiles
Create the section “Free membership”

#### 5. Latest videos
Create the section “Latest videos”

Copy the block “Most popular tutorials” to “Latest videos”

#### 6. ... and the footer!

#### 8. Prices grid
Create the prices grid

#### 9. Quotes section
Same as the Homepage, create the Carousel of quotes

#### 10. FAQ
Create the FAQ grid

#### Close the page with a footer

#### 13. Search filters
Create the search filters section

Dropdown is a nice way to create filters.

For the selected/placeholder value of both dropdown, no need to have dynamic value - static content is totally ok.

Create the result section of courses

You can reuse the same cell for testing. Don’t forget to test with odd and even number of cells.

#### 15. Close the page with a footer
mandatory
